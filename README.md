# Data_Mining_Lab3

 Data mining lab about Clustering and Text comparison

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tasks to do:
1.	Open the file lab3_ex011.py and read the code. 
2.	Open and read 2 files 'Eliot.txt' and 'Tolkien.txt' 
3.	Divide the each text into several parts (chunks) each one of size wind, using the given function partition_str(). 
4.	Construct the dictionary.
5.	Calculate frequency matrix wordFrequency in according to the dictionary. 
6.	Calculate the distance matrix dist. Reduce the distance matrix into dist1. 
7.	Save the matrix dist1 to the file dist1.npy
np.save('dist1',dist1,allow_pickle = True) 
8.	Close the current console. 
9.	Open the file lab3_ex012.py and read the code. 
10.	Load the file dist1.npy. 
11.	Cluster data dist1 using k-means algorithm. Specify k = 2 clusters. 
12.	Demonstrate the clustering results via bar plot. 
13.	Analyze the data partition into 2 clusters. 
14.	Calculate and show the silhouette values for k=2. 
Independent work 1:
15.	Cluster the same data dist1 into 3 clusters and show the clustering results.
16.	Calculate and show the silhouette values for k=3. 
17.	Use the silhouette method for finding optimal number of clusters. Compare the received values for k=2 and k=3. Make conclusion about optimal number of clusters. 
Independent work2:
18.	Add the text 'DB.txt', repeat the procedure for three given texts. 
19.	Specify k = 2, 3 and 4, use silhouette for finding optimal number of clusters and analyze the results.  

Clustering

Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).
 

Silhouette Value
The silhouette value for each point is a measure of how similar that point is to points in its own cluster, when compared to points in other clusters. The silhouette value Si for the ith point is defined as
Si = (bi-ai)/ max(ai,bi)
where ai is the average distance from the ith point to the other points in the same cluster as i, and bi is the minimum average distance from the ith point to points in a different cluster, minimized over clusters.
The silhouette value ranges from â€“1 to 1. A high silhouette value indicates that i is well matched to its own cluster, and poorly matched to other clusters. If most points have a high silhouette value, then the clustering solution is appropriate. If many points have a low or negative silhouette value, then the clustering solution might have too many or too few clusters. You can use silhouette values as a clustering evaluation criterion with any distance metric.
